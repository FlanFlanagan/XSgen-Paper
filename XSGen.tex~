\chapter{Introduction}
As the development and deployment of new nuclear reactor technologies increases, the impacts of these technologies must be fully characterized. One possible avenue for accomplishing this is using fuel cycle simulators capable of representing the physics the occurs inside these reactors. Several simulators exist, but not all can model the physics internal to these reactors. Some that are capable of this level of physics are COSI [citation needed], CLASS [citation needed] and certain modules within Cyclus [citation needed]. 
Bright-lite [citation needed] is a medium fidelity reactor model for Cyclus. It uses a fluence based approached to calculate appropriate discharge fluence, and isotopic vectors for a reactor. To accomplish this, it uses criticality, burnup, and transmutation matrices for each isotope of the reactors input fuel of a given reactor type. This information is generated using one group cross sections and a Bateman Equation solver. The reliance on one group cross sections means that the fidelity of the calculations is only as good as the data, and method, used to generate the one group cross sections. Therefore, improving the physics models used to generate the one group cross sections will improve the fidelity of the results generated by Bright-lite. 
XSGen is a new methodology aimed at developing higher accuracy cross sections. It couples a Monte Carlo software with a Bateman Equation solver.  By coupling the two software it is possible to generate fluence dependent values for neutron production, destruction, and transmutation matrices for each isotope as the flux spectrum within a reactor evolves. 
XSGen Work Flow
The XSGen work flow is composed of 3 main parts as mentioned above. The first step is the simulation of the reactor core using a Monte Carlo simulation. The results of this are then taken in by a wrapping software and converted into one group cross sections for a specific reactor. These cross sections are then used inside of the Bateman Equation software to calculation the burnup, neutron production, neutron destruction, and transmutation matrixes. This values are calculated at a user defined time length. The composition of the material at the end of the time step is then returned to the Monte Carlo simulator and the process is repeated. 
OpenMC
The software chosen to perform the Monte Carlo operations was OpenMC [OpenMC citation].  OpenMC was chosen due to its open source nature and ability to quickly perform the calculation required. The only information required from the results of the OpenMC run is the group fluxes. These are used later to calculation one group cross sections. 
Input templates for OpenMC can be added to the XSGen system as need reactor types become available for modeling. 
PyNE
PyNE, or Python for Nuclear Engineering [PyNE citation], is the software used to perform the group collapse. The functionality to perform this group collapse was added to PyNE to facilitate the coupling of these two software. The collapse is performed using the following method. 
The first thing that is computed is a collection of weights used to represent the background cross section for each isotope is created. These weights are important because the allow the system to incorporate self-shielding behavior into the collapsed cross sections. This done using the following equation.
